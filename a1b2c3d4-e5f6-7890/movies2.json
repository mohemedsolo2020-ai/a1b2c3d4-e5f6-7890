And so she prefers to stay the way she is, to observe and make her biting comments on whatever comes her way.",

When he discovers that she also steals from other bookstores, he is consumed with jealousy and starts living in a kind of love delirium, on the border between fiction and reality. The closer he gets to her, the more indescribable she becomes and he begins to wonder why she steals, what are her values and who is the older man she lives with. In the end, what is real and what isn’t? And will he find a place in her life as he moves away from his own?",

    "description": "In November 1918, a few days before the Armistice, when Lieutenant Pradelle orders a senseless attack, he causes a useless disaster; but his outrageous act also binds the lives of two soldiers who have nothing more in common than the battlefield: Édouard saves Albert, although at a high cost. They become companions in misfortune who will attempt to survive in a changing world. Pradelle, in his own way, does the same.",

Fatima is Maghreb like her husband but her children Nadia and Tarik were born in Italy: Nadia married an Italian Catholic against the wishes of her Muslim father and Tarik studies in England. The English university is the place where the destinies of Sean and Tarik meet because they both fall under the influence of Omar, a recruiter on behalf of the Jihad. Sean and Tarik, inflamed by the man's words, will enlist to fight in Syria, throwing their respective mothers into despair. Angela and Fatima's paths cross at a psychological support group run by Dr. Diana. The group also includes Israeli Sam, who killed a terrorist before he carried out a massacre, Claire, whose husband and son died in a jihadist air strike, and Eric, whose daughter Sofia joined the freedom fighters, coincidentally as Omar's concubine.",
