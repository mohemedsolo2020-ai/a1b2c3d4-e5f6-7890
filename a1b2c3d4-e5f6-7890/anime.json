And if you thought this unique group of students would overcome adversity and come together as one, you thought wrong again, as they continue to raise hell!\n\nYou can never tell what this atypical teacher is thinking and he never seems up for the task, but he always comes through when it counts. He and his students star in this school-life comedy full of laughs, tears, and the whole kitchen sink! Forget nerds, forget jocks, and come enjoy the kind of youthful days that only Gintama could ever deliver!",

He hopes her incredible magic can break a curse that will kill any woman he takes for a wife. However, when the prince sees how beautiful Tinasha is, he has a better idea—since she's surely strong enough to survive his curse, she should just marry him instead! Tinasha isn't keen on the idea but agrees to live with Oscar in the royal castle for a year while researching the spell placed on the prince. The witch's pretty face hides several lifetimes of dark secrets, however—secrets that begin resurfacing.",

Everywhere I look, I see her—in my house, in my school, in my class. There's no escape! She even claims that she's the older sibling. Like hell she is!\n\nBut I won't lose to her. After all, I'm the older brother in this new family situation. That's right, we're family now. No matter how much we may have thought we loved each other before, we saw one another's true colors and realized we weren't meant for each other. That's why even though we may keep up a buddy-buddy sibling act for the sake of our parents, things will never go back to the way they used to be.",

He never expected that Buddha would take his words literally, however, but the next thing he's aware of, he's in the body of a Shiba Inu named Shinamon in modern Japan! Less than thrilled at the fact that his human warlord consciousness is trapped in the instinct-bound body of an adorable house pet, Nobunaga struggles between making the best of it (he can have that ruff all the Europeans were wearing!) and being frustrated with his reality (the ruff turns out to be a bath hat and now he has to have a bath). Is it better or worse that many of his fellow warriors also seem to have been reincarnated in canine form – and that his enemy looks like he lucked out and got to be a human?",
